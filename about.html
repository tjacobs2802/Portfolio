      <p>Hello! I'm Trevor Jacobs,</p>
    </div>
      <div class="aboutinfo">
        <p>and this is my personal portfolio. I'm currently a 5th year senior at Michigan State University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree 
          in Computer Science in May of 2025. I am seeking to start a career at a place where I can apply my experience of software development, project design,
           and technical support. My mission with this webstie was to display my coding skills by creating this website from the ground up, and showcase the projects I've worked 
          on over the years. Here are some facts about me and my journey over the years:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interned at Gordon Food Service as an IT intern in 2023</li>
          <li>Started my college education at Grand Rapids Community College in 2020</li>
          <li>Made the deans list at GRCC</li>
          <li>Recieved the Theodora Quick Scholarship for excelling in Calculus</li>
          <li>Transferred to Michigan State in 2022</li>
          <li>Accepted into the 300 member Spartan Marching Band</li>

          <li>Awarded the Walter Adams Memorial Endowed Scholarship for leadership recognition and dedication to excellence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, I believe that all of these experiences can help me make a lasting impact at your company. For futher inquiry about
